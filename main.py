# Change the following print statement so that it uses the addition operator + and prints out 8

# Write a print statement that uses the division operator / 

# Add a print statement that uses multiplication *

# Create a variable called `length` and assign a value to it

# Create a variable called    `width` and assign a value to it

# Create a variable called `area` and assign to it the multiplication of `length` and `width`

# Print `area` in the following: "The result is " followed by the `area` variable


# BONUS: Print the area in the following syntax: "If the length of a rectangle is 5, and width is 3 then the area is: 15". Keep in mind that you should replace the numbers with their respective variables. 

print('Sarah')
numb1 = 7
numb2 = 1
print(numb1 + numb2)
print(10/5)
print(6*5)

length = 7
width = 10
area=(7*10)
print(F'the result is {area}')

length1= 5
width1= 3
area1= 15
print(f'If the length of the rectangle is {length1},and width is {width1},then the area is {area1}')
